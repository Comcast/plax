## Summary

Plax is a test automation engine for messaging systems.  This engine
is [designed](chans) to perform integrated testing of MQTT messaging,
Kinesis streams, SNS traffic, SQS [trafic](demos/sqs.yaml), Kafka I/O,
HTTP APIs, [subprocesses](demos/shell.yaml), mobile
[apps](demos/webdriver.yaml) (via
[WebDriver](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/)), and more.

An author of a test specifies a sequence of input and expected outputs
over a set of channels that are connected to external services.
Execution of the test verifies that the expected output occurred.


## Command-line tools in this repo

1. [`plax`](cmd/plax): The test engine (and probably the reason you
   are here).  Documentation is [here](doc/manual.md).
1. [`plaxrun`](cmd/plaxrun): Tool to run lots of Plax tests with
   various configurations.  Documentation is [here](doc/plaxrun.md).
1. [`yamlincl`](cmd/yamlincl): YAML include processor utility.
   Documenation is [here](doc/manual.md#including-yaml-in-other-yaml).


## Usage

Clone this repo and [install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install).
Then:

```Shell
(cd cmd/plax && go install)
# Run one simple test.
plax -test demos/mock.yaml -log debug
# Run several tests.
plax -dir demos -labels selftest
```

That last command runs all the [example test specs](demos) that are
labeled as `selftest`. [`basic.yaml`](demos/basic.yaml) is a good,
small example of a test specification.


## The langauge

See the [main documentation](doc/manual.md) and the [examples](demos).
