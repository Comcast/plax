              Get the response to the HTTP request.  The body has
              already been parsed as JSON, so we can use structured
              pattern matching to extract a value (id).  The matched
              value is stored in test.Bindings, which is automatically
              used in the next step to expand any embedded variables
              in payloads.

              body:
