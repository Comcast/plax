              Get the response to the HTTP request.  The body has
              already been parsed as JSON, so we can use structured
              pattern matching to extract a value (id).  The matched
              value is stored in test.Bindings, which is automatically
              used in the next step to expand any embedded variables
              in payloads.

        - pub:
            doc: |
              Use the extracted value in a message payload.  The
              variable 'id' is automatically expanded. (What about new
              variable collisions with test.Bindings?  Use a new
              variable if you don't want it replaced!)
