  Demonstration of using "star" variables to prevent one recv's
  bindings conflicting with a subsequent recv.  Also see
  bindings-conflict.yaml, bindings-deconflict.yaml,
  and bindings-clear.yaml.

  There are other ways to accomplish the same thing.

            Befor each 'recv', Plax will drop bindings for variables
            that start with '?*'.
        - recv:
