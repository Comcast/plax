  Demonstration of a technique to prevent one recv's bindings
  conflicting with a subsequent recv.  Also see bindings-clear.yaml,
  bindings-conflict.yaml, and bindings-star.yaml.

  There are other ways to accomplish the same thing.

        - recv:
            doc: |
              We'll bind the pattern variable '?x'.
            pattern: '{"want":"?x"}'
        - pub:
            payload: '{"want":"chips"}'
        - doc: |
            Before we do the next recv, let's drop the binding for
            '?x' that the previous recv established.  We could also
            run this same code in a guard for the previous recv or in
            a 'run' in the previous pub.
        - run: |
            delete(test.Bindings["?x"]);
        - recv:
            pattern: '{"want":"?x"}'
