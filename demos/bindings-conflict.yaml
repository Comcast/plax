  Demonstration of how one recv makes bindings that can conflict with
  a subsequent recv.  Also see bindings-clear.yaml,
  bindings-deconflict.yaml, and bindings-star.yaml.

  Note that this test is a negative test.  (It's expected to fail.)

    phase1:
      steps:
        - '$include<include/mock.yaml>'
        - pub:
            payload: '{"want":"queso"}'
        - recv:
            doc: |
              We'll bind the pattern variable '?x'.
            pattern: '{"want":"?x"}'
        - pub:
            payload: '{"want":"chips"}'
        - recv:
            doc: |
              The pattern variable '?x' was bound previously to
              'queso', so the following pattern is really
              '{"want":"queso"}', which will not match
              '{"want":"chips"}'.  As a result, this step will time
              out.

              This test is 'negative' (see above in this
              specification), so Plax will report that this test
              actually succeeded.
            pattern: '{"want":"?x"}'
            timeout: 1s
